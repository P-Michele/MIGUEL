MIGUEL is a minimalist esoteric programming language inspired by Brainfuck.
 The name “MIGUEL” comes from the language's main commands:

 1. M(ove to right)
 2. I(ncrement)
 3. G(o Back)
 4. U(p decrement)
 5. E(cho)
 6. ! Loop End
 7. ? Input (1 byte)

 The language is based on a 2048-byte buffer on which instructions can be written using a pointer to the current cell.
